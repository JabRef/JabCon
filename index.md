The conference is intended for users and developers of [JabRef](https://github.com/JabRef/jabref).
We want to strengthen the network between users, between users and developers, and between the developers.
The result of the conference should be new ideas for JabRef, fixed bugs, and newly implemented features.

The sessions will be subdivided into talks, workshops, and hacking sessions.

The conference is in **planning** state. We are currently fixing the details.
Any comments, questions, and feedback welcome.
